What you need:
	One computer with a webcam for each entrance and exit to the parking lot

What to do:
	Setup a computer at each entrance/exit to the parking lot, and point
	the cameras so they can see license plates of incoming/outgoing cars.
	Then, run scan.py on each computer, and enter the appropriate mode (entrance/exit)
	for each, depending on if the camera is looking at incoming or outgoing cars.
	
	Then, people using the parkingLotMonitor app should be able to get notifications
	when cars they track enter the parking lot.
